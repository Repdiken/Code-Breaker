---- 4-Digit Digital Door Lock Game ----

This project is a console-based mini-game developed as part of my final project for the first semester of Software Engineering.
It combines programming concepts I learned during the course with techniques and knowledge I researched independently.
The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated 4-digit code through logic and deduction.

Features:

Difficulty Levels:
Easy (10 attempts)
Normal (5 attempts)
Hard (3 attempts)
Input Validation: Ensures that players enter exactly 4 numeric digits.
Detailed Feedback:
Tells players which digits are correct and in the right position.
Identifies correct digits but in the wrong position.
Replay Option: Players can restart the game after completing a session.

Game Rules:

The game generates a random 4-digit code with unique digits (0-9).
The player has a limited number of attempts (based on the selected difficulty) to guess the code.
After each guess, the game provides feedback:
Correct and in Position: The digit is correct and in the correct position.
Correct but in Wrong Position: The digit is correct but not in the correct position.
If the player guesses all 4 digits correctly, they unlock the digital lock and win.
If the player exhausts all attempts, the game reveals the secret code.

This project allowed me to:

Apply Programming Fundamentals:
Utilize arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions in C.
Enhance Input Handling:
Implement robust input validation to ensure a smooth user experience.
Explore Randomization:
Create unique, non-repeating random numbers for the secret code.
Develop Problem-Solving Skills:
Debug and resolve logical errors during the development process.
Structure Code Efficiently:
Write clean, maintainable code with modular functions.
